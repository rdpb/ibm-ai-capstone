# IBM AI Workflow Capstone Project

The IBM AI Workflow capstone project is part of the evaluation for the [IBM AI Workflow Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-ai-workflow). 
In short, it simulates the full cycle of a data science project, and consists of understanding the data and the business opportunity related to a fictitious video streaming company; comparing models and choosing the adequate one; and developing a solution ready for deployment, including creating an API with the needed endpoints and building a Docker image to containing the solution. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/aavail/ai-workflow-capstone) or at the specialization website.

The project is composed of three parts. 
The first one involves investigating the data, searching for relationships therein, and articulating findings using visualizations.
The second one is comprised of trying different modelling approaches, and selecting one to be used for deployment, based on the observations.
Lastly, the third one consists of building a draft version of the API and serve it via a Docker image.
